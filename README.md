This project was developed using parts of the Corgi Engine by More Mountains.

Some code was written with the assistance of AI tools (ChatGPT).

The water system implementation is based on the publicly available tutorial:
"Unity 2D Water Tutorial in 100 Seconds" by Raycastly (YouTube),
and has been independently modified, extended, and shader-adjusted for this project.

All artwork, Spine animations, and visual assets were created by the author unless otherwise credited.
